# GenCyberPython
This repo supports a day of hands-on Python security coding.  
The audience isn't expected to be programming or security knowledgeable.

Four (4) lessons are provided in separate repos.  The lesson notebook provides step-by-step instructions.

1) Intro to Linux command line [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/kengraf/LinuxCommand/HEAD)

2) Using a railfence cipher [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/kengraf/Railfence/HEAD)

3) Image based steganography [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/kengraf/Steganography/HEAD)

4) TOTP (GoogleAuthenicator like) tokens [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/kengraf/TOTP/HEAD)

The startup of Binder.org takes a minute or so to establish an IPython
environment.  Then click on the lesson link ".ipynb: you would like to run.  Feel free to play/alter the steps
in the lessons.  You will be working a temporary sandbox, so can not damage the original lesson.
