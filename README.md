# GenCyberPython
This repo supports a day of hands-on Python security coding.  
The audience isn't expected to be programming or security knowledgeable.

Three (3) lessons are provided.  The lesson notebooks provide step-by-step instructions.

1) Using a railfence cipher
2) Using steganography with images
3) Using Oath (GoogleAuthenicator) tokens

Click on the binder button below.  Startup takes a minute or so to establish an IPython
environment.  Then click on the lesson you would like to run.  Feel free to play/alter the steps
in the lessons.  You will be working a temporary sandbox, so none your actions are saved or
impact anyones work.
